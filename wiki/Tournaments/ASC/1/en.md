## Ruleset

### General rules

1. This tournament is a **3v3 double-elimination tournament**, with a team size of 6 and a total of 16 teams. Only the top 96 players will be chosen to join this edition.
2. The tournament is open to all players who have country flags from Asia and Oceania in their profiles. Participants must have flags from these regions to be eligible for entry.
3. To sign up players must do so through the website and must be in the Discord server. Failure to do so will count your registration as incomplete and not eligible to participate.
4. Players' display names in the Discord server must be the same as their osu! username during the entire duration of the tournament.
5. A "sandbagging" formula will be used to help determine the true ranks of players to avoid disruptions and highly unbalanced teams that may potentially ruin the Suiji Cup experience. Player seedings and formula details will be revealed right before sign ups close.
6. Participants will be split up into 3 different seeds, "A", "B" and "C". Each team will be formed by a live randomization process and will consist of 2 players from each seed (a team will have 6 players, A, A, B, B, C, C).
7. "A" seeded players have the ability to substitute with "B" or "C" seed on their team. "B" seeded players also have the ability to substitute but only with "C" seed on their team.
8. Teams will be given 5 days to choose a team name and a captain. Failure to submit a team name and a captain will result in an assigned team name chosen by the staff and the highest-ranked player being made captain by default.
9. Staff **are not allowed to play** - except for streamers, commentators, and graphics designers.
10. Every staff and player must respect each other and follow the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules), no discussion about sensitive topics (for example religion, politics), and anything that could be offensive to others.
11. We reserve the right to decline players from participating in the tournament if they previously have been blacklisted, recently unrestricted accounts, and accounts that previously have failed the osu! staff screening.
12. Keep the competition and atmosphere friendly amongst each other, whether it is in the match, in the Twitch chat room, or on the Discord server. Tournaments are always for us to come together as a community and not engage in pointless arguments.
13. We're all here to have fun and have put a lot of effort into this tournament. Let's appreciate everyone's contributions, even if things sometimes go differently than planned. If you have any suggestions for improving the tournament, please feel free to share them in the appropriate channels on the Discord server. We're always open to your feedback and ideas!"

### Mappool format

The maps in this tournament will only consist of Long Note (LN) oriented maps, and cover 4 sub-categories of LNs which are used to categorise all mappools after this stage. See the graphics below for more information!

### Tournament procedure

#### Qualifiers

1. One player from each rank must be present in the lobby (One A, One B, One C). "A" seeded players have the ability to substitute with "B" or "C" seeds on their team. "B" seeded players also have the ability to substitute but only with "C" seed on their team.
2. The referee will notify the captains 10-15 minutes before the lobby is scheduled to start. Captains must ensure players are in the lobby on time.
3. Players will play the mappool in order from Stage 1-8 twice. There is a maximum 2-minute break in between each map. After the first cycle, players will be given a 5-minute break before continuing with the 2nd cycle which follows the same procedure. Players are allowed to skip this break if all players present in the lobby agree to start the 2nd run right away.
4. Teams can reschedule to a later qualifier lobby if they missed their scheduled lobby, the latest lobby that can be requested is by 7th June at 16:00 (UTC+0).

#### Bracket stage

1. Same as Qualifiers, one player from each rank must be present in the lobby (One A, One B, One C). "A" seeded players have the ability to substitute with "B" or "C" seed on their team. "B" seeded players also have the ability to substitute but only with "C" seed on their team.
2. The referee will notify the captains 15 minutes before the lobby is scheduled to start. Captains must ensure players are in the lobby on time to avoid delays.
3. Teams may provide a warmup map to the referee before the match starts, the map must be under 4 minutes and not contain any vulgar or provoking lyrics. Teams have the option to skip the warmup phase.
4. Captains will be required to !roll, the team with the higher roll will be allowed to ban first while the other team will be allowed to pick the first map. Teams have 2 minutes to choose a ban, otherwise, they will lose their ban.
5. Teams have 2 minutes to choose their picks, if they fail to pick a map within 2 minutes, the pick will be given to the other team. This will not affect the order of picks afterward.
6. Once a map has been chosen, teams will have 2 minutes to swap teammates and ready up. If the 2-minute timer ends, the referee will force a !mp start 5 commands, and the match will start with whoever is in the lobby.
7. Each team will receive one "timeout" of 2 minutes per match, to be used as extra time to pick a beatmap or to rest. The timeout may only be used by the player who is picking the next map, the only exception being during tiebreaker scenarios where both teams are given a two-minute timeout regardless.

### Additional information

1. Visual mods such as HD, FL, FI, and MR along with NF mod are allowed. Meanwhile, EZ and HR mod are not allowed.
2. In the event of a disconnection, the map can be replayed if the disconnect is within the first 30 seconds or before the first quarter of the map. Otherwise, if there is proof of the disconnected player's score, it will be used. Each team is allowed one replay per match, the referee will have the final say in disconnection situations.
3. If a player is not cooperative with the referee and intentionally stalls the match, they will be warned by the referee. If the problem persists the host has the power to end the match and decide the winner on the spot.
    Other special and unique cases that could happen will be up to the host to decide the next moves.

### Scheduling instructions

We, the Tournament staff will be responsible for scheduling all matches and informing players when they are scheduled to play. If a player is unable to play with the schedule they will have the option to request a reschedule, details about this topic will be explained further when the tournament begins.

We will do our best to schedule each match according to each player's preferred time to play.

1. If no referee is available during the match, the match shall be delayed.
2. If no streamers are available to broadcast the match, the match will still happen without being broadcast.
3. If no commentators are available to commentate the match but streamers are available to broadcast the match, the match will still be broadcasted but without commentary.
4. Please note that we will try our best to broadcast every match. If two matches happen at the same time we will prioritize:
   - The scheduled match over rescheduled matches.
   - The winner bracket match over the lower bracket match.
